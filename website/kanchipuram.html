    <h3>HISTORY</h3>
    <p>
        The Kailasanathar Temple (meaning: "Lord of Kailasa"), is built in the tradition of Smartha worship of Shiva, Vishnu, Devi, Surya (Sun), Ganesha and Kartikeya, in Hinduism.[citation needed]
        Temple construction is credited to the Pallava dynasty, who had established their kingdom with Kanchipuram (also known as "Kanchi" or "Shiva Vishnu Kanchi") as the capital city, considered one of the seven sacred cities under Hinduism. In Kanchi, after the Pallavas expanded their territories to the north, west and south both within Tamil, Andhra and Kannada territories under Emperor Narasimhavarman I, they started expanding their capital city of Kanchipuram and built many temples of great magnificence. Among the two unique specimens of temple architecture of the period 640â€“730 CE are the Tiru Parameswara Vinnagaram, which is also known as the Vaikunta Perumal temple and the Kailasanathar Temple.[10]

    <h3>Geography</h3>
    <p>
        The temple is located towards the west of Kanchipuram city, and is about 75 kilometres (47 mi) from Chennai.[9] Its location, demarcated according to the religious faiths, is in one of three "Kanchis", the Shiva Kanchi; the other two Kanchis are, Vishnu Kanchi and Jain Kanchi.[citation needed] The Kailasanathar Temple is one of several notable temples in Kanchipuram, the others being Ekambaranatha, Kachapeshwarar, Kamakshi Amman, Kumarakottam Temple, and Varadaraja Perumal.

    <h3>Other features</h3>
    <p>
        The outstanding feature of sculptures is the profusion of depiction of the erect lions projecting out in several directions.[citation needed]There are two sculptures of Shiva here which are seen holding the alapini veena (musical string instrument) in the hand. There is a lot of difference between the veenas found in the said sculptures and the present day veena.[17] There are also beautiful sculptures of Mathahvialasa Prakshanam. The temple also has the earliest stone inscription which records of the twenty eight Saivagamas (Shaiva saints) in which the Pallava King Rajasimhavarman states his faith in Shaivism.[18] The murals on the inner walls[citation needed] are well preserved.
