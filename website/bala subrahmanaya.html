    <h3>HISTORY</h3>
    <p>
        Until 1947 this area was in the realm of the Travancore Kings. The temple is situated on the banks of Hanumannathi River. 
        Sri Hanuman was said to have stopped by and rested on the banks of this river on his way to Lanka, hence the river was named
        Hanumannathi River. This is why Rama and Subramanya are popular names in this region.

    <p>
        Lord Karthikeya appears among five Vrikshas (trees) and the five Devatas in the form of a young Balasubramanya. The five Vrikshams are Arasu (Surya), 
        Vembu neem (Ambhikai), Kariveppilai Curry leaves tree ( Mahesha), Madhulai (Ganesha) & Mavilangu (Vishnu).

        A devotee named Mallan at Nanjaipara found the main deity Idol of the temple in the Mallam River. Once there lived a Brahmin Mugura Bhakthar sanyasi
         who obtained SamƒÅdhi in that area. His samadhi was built on the shores of Hanumannathi River. An Arasa Tree was planted at that place & his community conducted pujas & ceremonies there. 
         The idol of Balasubramanya that was found at Mallapuram was installed on the samadhi of that Sanyasi and the pujas were continued.

    <h3>Special ways of Prayer</h3>
    <p>
        The Arasa leaf Vibhuthi Prasadham (Holy Ash) available in this temple is very powerful. Padi Payasam, Kavadi, Pallkudam are some of the important ways in which the devotees 
        show their love to the Lord. According to legend, on the steps leading to the Hanumannathi River Sri Balamuruga takes payasam along with other children.
